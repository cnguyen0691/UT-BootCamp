# Movie JSON Dump

## File

* [`movie-json-dump`](Unsolved/movie-json-dump)

## Instructions

* Using `2-movie-json-dump.html` in `06-MovieJSONDump` as starter code, add functionality such that clicking `Movie Search` triggers an AJAX call to the OMDb database and the JSON response to be appended onto the page.

* If you finish early, begin reading about the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/). Try to understand how to search for a specific artist. Then try to understand how to search for tracks associated with that artist. As a final step, try to figure out how to get a "spotify player" to display on your webpage.
