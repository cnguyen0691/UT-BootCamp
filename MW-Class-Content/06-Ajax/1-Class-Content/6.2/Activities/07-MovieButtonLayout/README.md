# Movie Button Layout

## File

* [`movie-button-layout-easier`](Unsolved/movie-button-layout-easier) or [`movie-button-layout-harder`](Unsolved/movie-button-layout-harder)

## Instruction

* Using either `movie-button-layout-easier.html` or `movie-button-layout-harder.html` as a starting-point, replicate the functionality of the application just demonstrated to you.

* Your final code should:

  * Dynamically generate the initial buttons using jQuery

  * Allow users to create new buttons upon entering text in the textbox and clicking `Add a Movie Bro`.

  * If you finish early begin reading about the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/). Try to understand how to search for a specific artist. Then try to understand how to search for tracks associated with that artist. As a final step, try to figure out how to get a "spotify player" to display on your webpage.
